### 🛠️ About Me

I'm a software engineer who finds joy in crafting clean, reliable, and scalable systems.  
Whether it's building powerful APIs in **.NET**, weaving business logic with **Spring Boot**, or assembling full solutions in **PHP**, I believe good code is both art and structure.

I don’t just build apps — I design solutions, automate processes, and constantly seek better ways to connect logic with purpose.
